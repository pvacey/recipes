- preheat oven to 450Â°F, **with the dutch oven inside to get it hot**
- once oven is done preheating, remove the dutch oven
- flour your hands, the dough, and the bottom of the pan
- form the dough into a ball (do not knead it)
- plop the dough ball into the center of the dutch oven
- put the dutch oven into the oven oven and bake for 30 minutes with the lid on
- remove the lid and bake for 15-20 minutes, until golden brown

- super good with garlic and herb butter
- we let the dough rise on our oven top which is always slightly warm from the pilot light
