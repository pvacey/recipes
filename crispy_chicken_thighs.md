# crispy chicken thighs
from *Lodge Cast Iron Nation* cook book

## ingredients
- 6 chicken thighs (skin-on)
- 2 teaspoons vegatable oil
- salty seasoning of your choice (salt and pepper works)

## process
1. preheat oven to 425Â°F
1. season the chicken thighs with whatever you want
1. heat the oil in a 12" cast iron skillet
1. place the chicken thighs in the pan skin-side down
1. cook on medium high heat covered for 12 minutes, rotating every 3-4 minutes to ensure even cooking
1. put the skillet in the oven and cook 12 minutes, uncovered
1. use tongs to flip the chicken skin-side up, cook in the oven for another 2-3 minutes until the skin is crisy and brown

## notes
- adding minced garlic to the chicken is great
- if the skin is not crispy and brown at the end, put it in the broiler and it crisp it up quickly
