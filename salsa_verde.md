# salsa verde

# ingredients
- 8 serrano peppers
- 2 poblano peppers
- 1 white onion
- 4 big cloves of garlic
- 2 lbs of tomatillos
- 1/2 cilantro bunch
- salt (amount is up to you, start slow)
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1/2 lime

# process
1. peel and wash tomatillos, there is a sticky residue on them, add to a large pot
1. peel garlic, peel and quarter the onion, add to the pot
1. fill the pot with just enough water to submerge them everything
1. slice serrano and and poblano peppers lengthwise, place on baking sheet skin side up
1. broil the peppers until the skin is blackened (some finish faster than others, keep checking and pluck them out as they get dark enough)
1. add the roasted peppers to the pot, bring the water to a boil
1. continue boiling until tomatillos darkens and are soft enough that squeezing them gently with tongs will break their skin
1. pour off about 2 cups of the water (to add back later), completely drain the rest of the water
1. add the cilantro and blend everything
1. now you will cook the blended salsa, heat a clean pot with 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil
1. carefully pour the blended salsa into the hot oil (water, oil, and heat are a nightmare combo if the oil is too hot, it can get splattery so pour slowly)
1. add about 1/2 cup of the vegetable water back to the salsa and stir the salsa, oil, and water combo well
1. add some salt, start slow and add more when you're nearly done cooking
1. simmer for 20 minutes and stir occasionally, you will notice the color darkening more
1. add more water or more boiling time to get the consistency you're looking for
1. let the mixture cool, then eat, keep refrigerated

# notes
- it is difficult to taste test the flavor when the salsa is boiling hot, don't be afraid to wait until it has cooled to add more salt
- the spiciness of serranos varies batch by batch which makes hard to predict if you are going to be in pain or wondering where the heat is
- this is SUPER GOOD if you mix a small portion of it with avocado
  - make sure to do this when the salsa is room temp or colder, otherwise the avocado turns gross
  - the avocado salsa combo spoils much faster than the salsa itself, which is why I recommend making a small amount at a time separate from the main batch
