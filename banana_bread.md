# banana bread
from my mom

## ingredients
- 1/2 cup butter
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup sugar
- 3 over ripe bananas
- 2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon
- (optional) chocolate chips, measured with your heart
- cooking spray or a stick of butter to coat the bread pan

## process
1. preheat oven to 350Â°F
1. melt the butter then whisk with the eggs and sugar in a large mixing bowl
1. add your (obviously peeled) bananas to the mixture, mash them thoroughly 
1. add in the flour, baking soda, and cinnamon, mix until you can not longer find any pockets of dry ingredients
1. optionally, stir in chocolate chips
1. grease the bread pan (8.5in x 4.5in i believe is the standard size) with either cooking spray or butter (rub it on with a cold stick of butter as if it's a glue stick)
1. pour the batter into the greased up pan, a rubber spatula is immensely helpful for getting all of the batter out of the mixing bowl
1. bake in the oven for about 60 minutes, rotate the pan after about 30 minutes to ensure even baking
1. the bread is done once you can poke a butter knife into the center of the loaf and it comes out relatively clean of batter (if you added chocolate chips they will be melty no matter what), keep baking until it's no longer *overly* gooey in the center, it doesn't have to be bone dry, getting this right is an art 
1. once the bread is done baking, place the pan on your stove top and place a clean folded towel on top of the loaf to trap the heat in for a while longer, this helps soften the top crust
1. let it cool at least an hour and a half before slicing

## notes
- the original recipes calls for 2 large bananas but I have found that 2 bananas usually produces pretty dry bread, 3 is better but if you only have 2... go for it
- I like to store it in the fridge, I think it tastes better cold and it keeps longer
- try spreading peanut butter on a slice, it's the only way I ever want to eat it
