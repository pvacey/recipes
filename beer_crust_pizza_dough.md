# beer crust pizza dough

## ingredients
- 3/4 cup warm beer (105-115°F), see [notes](#notes)
- 1 1/4oz packet of active dry yeast (2 1/2 teaspoons)
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 2 3/4 to 3 cups all purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons salt
- the rest of the beer, room temperature

## process
1. heat 3/4 cup of beer to (105-115°F)
1. stir in the sugar and the yeast, mix well
1. wait about 10 minutes, you should see bubbles forming as the yeast activates
1. in a mixing bowl: dump in yeasty beer mixture and add salt
1. add flour in small increments and stir with a spatula as you go (it is way easier than dumping all of the flour in at once)
1. at some point as you are adding flour in it becomes solid enough that spatula is useless, flour your hand up a bit and start using it instead 
1. sprinkle some flour on your counter, plop the dough down onto it, and then knead it (flatten it out, fold over onto itself, repeat)
1. as you are kneading, pour on small amounts of extra beer or extra flour until the dough is wet enough to not have dry pockets of flour but not so sticky that it's glued to your hands (this is an art)
1. keeping kneading for about 5-10 minutes, lose yourself in the rhythm of this process, punch the dough a bit if you're pissed off at it
1. find a large bowl/container for the dough to rise in, make sure it is large enough to allow the dough to expand to twice the size it currently is
1. coat the inside of the container with either olive oil or cooking spray
1. plop the dough into the lubed up container, roll it around in there so it is lubed up itself and will not stick to the container
1. cover the container with either plastic wrap or a lid if it has one
1. let the dough rise for at least 3 hours in a slightly warm spot - on top of the oven works well if your stovetop has pilot light
1. when your are ready to roll the dough out to make your pizza, put a bit of flour or cornmeal on your pan so the crust doesn't stick
1. bake your pizza at 425°F, idk how long just watch it

## notes
- beer choice - it is best to avoid light beer, use a grainy "wet yellow" style beer like miller high life or old style
- after letting the dough rise at slightly warm/room temp for at least 3 hours, you can refrigerate this for up to a few days
  - if you refrigerate the dough take it out at least 2 hours before using it at let it return to room temp, it will be much easier to roll it out
